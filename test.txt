to explore strange new worlds,
to seek out new life and new civilizations yee
I think software engineering experiments are very interesting
as they can help us improve many programming skills and teamwork abilities
Like father,like son
Better late than never
All roads lead to Rome
All that glitters is not gold
As you sow,so shall you reap
As you sow,so shall you reap
Birds of a feather flock together
Birds of a feather flock together
